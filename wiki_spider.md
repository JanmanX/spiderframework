## Introduction ##
The WikiSpider uses Spider.Net to download the content from Wikipedia website(en.wikipedia.org) to file.

## Why WikiSpider? ##
The main reason of this project is we need a plenty of text data from Internet. So, I create this spider to download text content from Wikipedia. The default setting is to download 10000 text file from Wikipedia and sleep 500ms after each file has been parsed.

## Note ##
1. This is an example of Spider.Net.
2. Please DO NOT speed up the spider, otherwise Wikipedia will know what's going on.
3. This project doesn't have the responsibilities of what you do to Wikipedia website.
