# Spider.Net #

Spider.Net is a generic web crawler framework. It contains a base framework, a runtime, and a sample runtime environment. The base framework name Spider Framework, the core of Spider.Net, provides many building blocks for a web crawler construction. The runtime named Spider Runtime driven by an XML configuration file constructs and executes a web crawler dynamically. The sample runtime environment named SREnvironment provides a simple user interface to choose an XML configuration file and use this file to drive a runtime execution. After execution, the result can be saved as a XML document which is dumped from DataSet in .Net Framework.

With Spider.Net, you can build your owned web crawler easily.



**Programming Language: C#, .Net Framework**
