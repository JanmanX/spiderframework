#summary Does Web Screenshot run as service??

Sorry, the answer is "NO". Web Screenshot uses WIN32 API to draw image. That means it copies image from its window in your computer. If you run it as an unlogged-in user, it doesn't have a displayed window, and so it can't draw the web site image for you.
