There are only a few web site supports interoperability, such as Google, Youtube, etc. But, there are still a plenty of web sites running on HTML based technologies which render pure HTML or JavaScript to user. This is the origin of Spider.Net.

Spider.Net helps you to parse data on web. The data parsed by Spider.Net is stored in a DataSet of .Net Framework. You can transform it to database. With this data, you can do anything you want.
