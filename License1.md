What is the license of Spider Framework??

Ans: LGPLv3.

No matter what the link in the right side of this website, it is LGPLv3.

## Modification ##

You don't have to open your owned code to your customer. But, if you modify any of my code, you **NEED** to open the modification you made to your customer who buy or receive your software from you, if they want.

## Derivation ##

LGPL allows you to use this code in any place you want. That means you can use it to create another large work, or to extend its functionalities by providing other implementations, etc.  The most great part is you can own the code created by you. You can also choose the license of your code.


That's my understanding of LGPLv3. If you feel some of them wrong, please email me asap and I will correct them.
